🌈✨ Hi, I'm a Software Engineer specializing in backend development! ✨🌈

🧑‍💻 Tech Stack:
- Java (Spring Boot)
- Python (Flask, FastAPI)
- Go (Echo)
- TypeScript (Express)
- C (for fun and unique projects!)

💡 Recently, I challenged myself to implement a simple GPT inference engine from scratch in C — mixing old-school performance with modern AI magic. Check out my repo for details!

🎬 When I’m not coding, you’ll find me:
- Binge-watching anime & American TV series 🍿
- Grooving to music 🎵
- Learning new languages (spoken ones, not just programming! 🌍)

I thrive in colorful, animated environments — both in code and in life. Always eager to connect with fellow developers, language learners, or anyone with a passion for tech and pop culture!

Let’s connect! 🚀
